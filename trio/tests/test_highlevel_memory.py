        # would be a pretty weird and annoying side-effect to spring on
        # users. So test that this doesn't happen, by forcing the
        # bytearray's underlying buffer to be realloc'ed:
        data += bytes(BIG)

        # testing anything, because:
        # - on CPython, the refcount GC generally cleans up memoryviews
        #   for us even if we're sloppy.
        # - on PyPy3, at least as of 5.7.0, the memoryview code and the
        #   bytearray code conspire so that resizing never fails â€“ if
        #   resizing forces the bytearray's internal buffer to move, then
        #   all memoryview references are automagically updated (!!).
